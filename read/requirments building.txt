Generate requirements:
1. Method 1 -  pip freeze > requirements.txt
2. Method 2 - Use pipreqs - pipreqs used to generate requirements.txt file for any project based on imports


Why not pip freeze ?

pip freeze saves all packages in the environment including those that you don’t use in your current project. (if you don’t have virtualenv)
pip freeze only saves the packages that are installed with pip install in your environment.
sometimes you just need to create requirements.txt for a new project without installing modules.

pip install pipreqs
pipreqs /path/to/project

3. Method 3
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt setup.py
