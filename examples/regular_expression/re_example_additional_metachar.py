# Some more metacharacters are *, +, ?, { and }.
# These specify numbers of repetitions.
# The metacharacter * means "zero or more repetitions of the previous thing".
# It tries to match as many repetitions as possible.

# The "previous thing" can be a single character, a class, or a group of characters in parentheses.
