    # Enum member values
# Member values can be anything: int, str, etc..
# If the exact value is unimportant you may use auto instances and an appropriate value will be chosen for you.
# Care must be taken if you mix auto with other values.

#ote Nomenclature
# The class Color is an enumeration (or enum)
# The attributes Color.RED, Color.GREEN, etc., are enumeration members (or enum members) and are functionally constants.
# The enum members have names and values (the name of Color.RED is RED, the value of Color.BLUE is 3, etc.)

# Even though we use the class syntax to create Enums, Enums are not normal Python classes. See How are Enums different? for more details.
