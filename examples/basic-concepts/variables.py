# To assign a variable, use one equals sign.
# Unlike most lines of code we've looked at so far, it doesn't produce any output at the Python console.

x = 7
print(x)
# 7

print(x + 3)
# 10

print(x)
# 7

spam = "eggs"
print(spam * 3)
# eggseggseggs


# Variables can be reassigned as many times as you want,
# in order to change their value.

# In Python, variables don't have specific types, so you can
# assign a string to a variable, and later
# assign an integer to the same variable
# However, it is not good practice.
#  To avoid mistakes, try to avoid overwriting the same variable with different data type
x = 123.456
print(x)
# 123.456

x = "This is a string"
print(x + "!")
# This is a string!
