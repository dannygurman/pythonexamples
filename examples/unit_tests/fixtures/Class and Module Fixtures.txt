Class and module level fixtures are implemented in TestSuite. When the test suite encounters a test from a new class then tearDownClass() from the previous class (if there is one) is called, followed by setUpClass() from the new class.

Similarly if a test is from a different module from the previous test then tearDownModule from the previous module is run, followed by setUpModule from the new module.

After all the tests have run the final tearDownClass and tearDownModule are run.

The default ordering of tests created by the unittest test loaders is to group all tests from the same modules and classes together.
This will lead to setUpClass / setUpModule (etc) being called exactly once per class and module.

 If you randomize the order, so that tests from different modules and classes are adjacent to each other,
 then these shared fixture functions may be called multiple times in a single test run.
