Data Hiding

A key part of object-oriented programming is encapsulation, which involves packaging of related variables
and functions into a single easy-to-use object - an instance of a class.

A related concept is data hiding, which states that implementation details of a class
should be hidden, and a clean standard interface be presented for those who want to use the class.

In other programming languages, this is usually done with private methods and attributes,
 which block external access to certain methods and attributes in a class.

The Python philosophy is slightly different.
 It is often stated as "we are all consenting adults here", meaning that you shouldn't put arbitrary
 restrictions on accessing parts of a class.
  Hence there are no ways of enforcing a method or attribute be strictly private.
However, there are ways to discourage people from accessing parts of a class,
 such as by denoting that it is an implementation detail, and should be used at their own risk.
