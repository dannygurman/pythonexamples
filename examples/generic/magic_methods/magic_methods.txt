Magic methods are special methods which have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names.

They are also known as dunders.

So far, the only one we have encountered is __init__, but there are several others.

They are used to create functionality that can't be represented as a normal method.

One common use of them is operator overloading.

This means defining operators for custom classes that allow operators such as + and * to be used on them.
An example magic method is __add__ for +.

More magic methods for common operators:
__sub__ for -
__mul__ for *
__truediv__ for /
__floordiv__ for //
__mod__ for %
__pow__ for **
__and__ for &
__xor__ for ^
__or__ for |

The expression x + y is translated into x.__add__(y).

However, if x hasn't implemented __add__, and x and y are of different types, then y.__radd__(x) is called.

There are equivalent r methods for all magic methods just mentioned.


Python also provides magic methods for comparisons.
__lt__ for <
__le__ for <=
__eq__ for ==
__ne__ for !=
__gt__ for >
__ge__ for >=

If __ne__ is not implemented, it returns the opposite of __eq__.
There are no other relationships between the other operators.


here are several magic methods for making classes act like containers.
__len__ for len()
__getitem__ for indexing
__setitem__ for assigning to indexed values
__delitem__ for deleting indexed values
__iter__ for iteration over objects (e.g., in for loops)
__contains__ for in

There are many other magic methods that we won't cover here, such as __call__ for calling objects as
functions, and __int__, __str__, and the like, for converting objects to built-in types.
