# There are various special sequences you can use in regular expressions.
# They are written as a backslash followed by another character.

# One useful special sequence is a backslash and a number between 1 and 99,  e.g., \1 or \17.
# This matches the expression of the group of that number.

#Note, that "(.+) \1" is not the same as "(.+) (.+)",
# because \1 refers to the first group's subexpression,
# which is the matched expression itself, and not the regex pattern


import re

pattern = r"(.+) \1"

match = re.match(pattern, "word word")
if match:
   print ("Match 1")
   #Match 1

match = re.match(pattern, "?! ?!")
if match:
   print ("Match 2")
   #Match 2

match = re.match(pattern, "abc cde")
if match:
   print ("Match 3")


#(abc|xyz)\1 match "abc" or "xyz", followed by the same thing


# More useful special sequences are \d, \s, and \w.
# These match digits (\d_, whitespace (\s) , and word characters  (\w) respectively.

# In ASCII mode they are equivalent to [0-9] (\d), [ \t\n\r\f\v] (\s), and [a-zA-Z0-9_] (\w).

# In Unicode mode they match certain other characters, as well.
#
# For instance, \w matches letters with accents.

# Versions of these special sequences with upper case letters -
# \D, \S, and \W - mean the opposite to the lower-case versions.
# For instance, \D matches anything that isn't a digit.


#(\D+\d) matches one or more non-digits followed by a digit.
pattern = r"(\D+\d)"

match = re.match(pattern, "Hi 999!")

if match:
   print("Match 1")
   #Match 1

match = re.match(pattern, "1, 23, 456!")
if match:
   print("Match 2")

match = re.match(pattern, " ! $?")
if match:
    print("Match 3")

# [1-6!] and (\d*\W)+ match  "123!456!"


# #Additional special sequences are \A, \Z, and \b.
# The sequences \A and \Z match the beginning and end of a string, respectively.

# The sequence \b matches the empty string between \w and \W characters,
# or \w characters and the beginning or end of the string.
# Informally, it represents the boundary between words.

# The sequence \B matches the empty string anywhere else.

#"\b(cat)\b" basically matches the word "cat" surrounded by word boundaries.
pattern = r"\b(cat)\b"

match = re.search(pattern, "The cat sat!")
if match:
   print ("Match 1")
   #Match 1

match = re.search(pattern, "We s>cat<tered?")
if match:
   print ("Match 2")
   #Match 2

match = re.search(pattern, "We scattered.")
if match:
   print ("Match 3")

# SP\AM!\Z match 'SPAM!'
