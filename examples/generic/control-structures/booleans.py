# Another type in Python is the Boolean type.
# There are two Boolean values: True and False.
# They can be created by comparing values, for instance by using the equal operator ==.

# Be careful not to confuse assignment (one equals sign) with comparison (two equals signs).

my_boolean = True
print(my_boolean)
# True

print(2 == 3)
# False
print("hello" == "hello")
# True

# Comparison
print(1 != 1)
# False

print("eleven" != "seven")
# True

print(2 != 10)
# True

print(7 > 5)
# True

print(10 < 10)
# False

print (7 <= 8)
# True
