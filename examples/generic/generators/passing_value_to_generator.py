#In PEP 342, support was added for passing values into generators. PEP 342 gave generators the power to yield a value (as before),
# receive a value, or both yield a value and receive a (possibly different) value in a single statement.


#To illustrate how values are sent to a generator, let's return to our prime number example.
# This time, instead of simply printing every prime number greater than number, #
# we'll find the smallest prime number greater than successive powers of a number (i.e. for 10,
# we want the smallest prime greater than 10, then 100, then 1000,
