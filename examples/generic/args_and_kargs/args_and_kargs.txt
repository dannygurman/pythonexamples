 *args and **kwargs

I have come to see that most new python programmers have a hard time figuring out the *args and **kwargs magic variables.
 So what are they ? First of all let me tell you that it is not necessary to write *args or **kwargs.
 Only the * (asterisk) is necessary.

 You could have also written *var and **vars.
  Writing *args and **kwargs is just a convention.
  So now lets take a look at *args first.


  . Usage of *args
*args and **kwargs are mostly used in function definitions.
 *args and **kwargs allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.

 What variable means here is that you do not know beforehand how many arguments can be passed to your function
 by the user so in this case you use these two keywords.

 *args is used to send a non-keyworded variable length argument list to the function.
