pip install Flask

The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a simple calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications
or frameworks written in the Python programming languagw

$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

 C:\path\to\app>set FLASK_APP=hello.py

 Alternatively you can use python -m flask:

$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ python -m flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

 If you have the debugger disabled or trust the users on your network, you can make the server publicly available simply by adding --host=0.0.0.0 to the command line:

flask run --host=0.0.0.0
This tells your operating system to listen on all public IPs.

 If you enable debug support the server will reload itself on code changes, and it will also provide you with a helpful debugger if things go wrong.

To enable all development features (including debug mode) you can export the FLASK_ENV environment variable and set it to development before running the server:

$ export FLASK_ENV=development (set on windows)
$ flask run

This does the following things:
it activates the debugger
it activates the automatic reloader
it enables the debug mode on the Flask application.
You can also control debug mode separately from the environment by exporting FLASK_DEBUG=1.
