The concurrent.futures module is part of the standard library which provides a high level API for launching async tasks. We will discuss and go through code samples for the common usages of this module.

Executors
This module features the Executor class which is an abstract class and it can not be used directly.
 However it has two very useful concrete subclasses â€“
  ThreadPoolExecutor and
  ProcessPoolExecutor.

  As their names suggest, one uses multi threading and the other one uses multi-processing.
  In both case, we get a pool of threads or processes and we can submit tasks to this pool.
The pool would assign tasks to the available resources (threads or processes) and schedule them to run.

we would want to use the ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU intensive tasks.
 The ThreadPoolExecutor is better suited for network operations or I/O.
