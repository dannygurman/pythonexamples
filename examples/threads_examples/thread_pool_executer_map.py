#Executor.map()

# Both executors have a common method â€“ map().
# Like the built in function,
# the map method allows multiple calls to a provided function,
# passing each of the items in an iterable to that function.
#
# Except,# in this case, the functions are called concurrently.
# For multiprocessing, this iterable is broken into chunks and each of these chunks is passed to the function in separate processes.
# We can control the chunk size by passing a third parameter, chunk_size.
# By default the chunk size is 1.
